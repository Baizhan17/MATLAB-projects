The provided code simulates a wireless sensor network scenario with dynamic node movements, adaptive communication ranges, 
and obstacle avoidance. Users can input parameters such as the number of nodes, network dimensions, obstacles, source-destination pairs,
 and simulation iterations through a dialog box. The nodes move randomly within the network, adjusting their communication ranges based on 
distances to source nodes. Additionally, an obstacle avoidance strategy is implemented, where nodes alter their positions when close to
 obstacles. The code monitors nodes for low energy levels, providing a notification if any node falls below a threshold. This simulation 
allows users to visualize the dynamic behavior of nodes, the impact of obstacles, and the adaptation of communication ranges. 
The performance of the code depends on the chosen parameters, providing insights into energy consumption, potential obstacles,
 and the overall robustness of the wireless sensor network.
